Медиана устойчивее к выбросам и асимметрии, тогда как среднее более зависима и будет смещаться в случае выбросов.\n","\n","Процентиль — это значение, ниже или равно которому находится заданная доля наблюдений, выраженная в процентах (95-й процентиль — порог, ниже которого лежат 95% данных, а выше — 5% данных).\n","\n","Боксплот показывает сводку пяти чисел с выбросами (минимум, Q1, Q2 - медиана, Q3, максимум/усы). Гистограмма показывает распределение значений по интервалам (х) и их частоты (у)\n","\n","С помощью метода unique() вычислила уникальные значения по признаку Certificate. - их 15.\n","\n","Количество фильмов по каждому уникальному значению посчитала через value_counts(). Наиболее часто встречающееся значение - \"15\". Оно встретилось 1843 раза.\n","\n","5 наиболее встречаемых значений признака составляют более 80% от общего количества, количество наименее встречаемых значений очень мало, что при построении столбчатой диаграммы визуально не прослеживаются.\n","\n","При построении круговой диаграммы учитывались 5 наиболее встречаемых классов, что помогает наглядно увидеть долю каждого из них.\n","\n","Между двумя количественными признаками runtime_clear и gross_earn_clear присутствует слабая нелинейная взаимосвязь. Визуально это оценивается через диаграмму рассеяния jointplot - нет ровного тренда.\n","\n","Взаимосвязь категориальных признаков отражается через множественные круговые диаграммы (фасеты). В случае с признаками \"режиссер\"-\"класс фильма\" видно, что доли заметно различаются, что указывает на зависимость признаков между собой.\n","Для лучшей визуализации круговой диаграммы \"pie\" количество признаков сократили до 5. И через цикл for вычислили значения второго признака для нужного количества первого признака.\n","\n","Для анализа взаимосвязи количественного и категориального признаков используется диаграмма боксплот (ящик с усами). По оси X — категории (качественный признак), по оси Y — количественный показатель. Длинный верхний «ус» против короткого нижнего: хвост распределения вытянут вверх, что соответствует положительной асимметрии и наличию редких, но крупных значений выше верхней границы IQR. Медиана смещена к нижней границе «ящика»: основная доля значений сосредоточена в нижней половине IQR, а верхняя половина более растянута, что свидетельствует о несимметричном разбросе относительно центра."],"metadata":{"id":"DrQ0mhH9o1vg"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"13EIiF1mo-5n8rhIOazpTl32ELbPG7lBy","timestamp":1768225046557},{"file_id":"1-B2Md_mOa1AuyiDEWe9C53DUXpBrRdDc","timestamp":1758962903940},{"file_id":"1zlyFlMe_ksM8faruKzMlFb0J4E1TbOB8","timestamp":1675158807370}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
